# Personal Website
## https://joemacam.com

Hi there! Thanks for visiting the repository for my website! This is my first time creating my own personal website to advertise myself, and also the first time creating a website using Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, and Three.js (My previous experience has been with Django and Python).

This website is by no means a work of art, and there are still quite a few improvements I could make for future personal website iterations in the future (better CSS management, mobile-first resonsive design, and improving pre-coding layout planning to name a few), but that's the fun thing about learning: I get to bring to light my weaknesses and take steps to imrpove myself as a Computer Scientist and programmer!
